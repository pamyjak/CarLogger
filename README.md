## CarLogger
- Here is the source code for my CarLogger App!
- The main code for this project can be found in [App.js](https://github.com/pamyjak/CarLogger/blob/master/App.js) and [Styles.js](https://github.com/pamyjak/CarLogger/blob/master/Styles.js)
- I started this project to begin my journey in Full-Stack development
- My aim is to create a working mobile app to help myself and others log information about their car(s)
